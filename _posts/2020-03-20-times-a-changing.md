### [Life on the outside ain't what it used to be](https://youtu.be/wvSHhm6R7dQ)
It's been a big month since I got back from Prague. Everyone I know and love has gone on powerful mood stabilizers, and retreated into a maze of delusion and enablement. As the beacon on uncompromising truth, this means withdrawing from me, personally, out of fear that I might [break the walls they guarded](#). I wish them good fortune in The Maze, but I can't save them when they've turned away from The Light. They are lost to me now, maybe forever.

A reckoning is at hand: Faith in institutions is crumbling, making way for a new order to rise up. [Invest in cults](#), my dear bhikhus. The young and strong of good epistemics will be uplifted as the outworn, weak and foolish drown in their own snot. This is a boundless opportunity, to those brave, vigilant, and determined enough te seek it. While the world sleeps, the Yogi remains 「awakened」

Yesterday was the spring equinox.

### The world's gone crazy, and it ain't safe on the streets
I moved to a beautiful Airbnb in the Claremont hills to wait out the storm. I'm really glad I came, the sense of peace is hard to quantify. I do really miss my rowing machine and colossal [34" monitor](#) but I think it's a fair tradeoff.

I'm pretty well stocked. Complete packing list is as follow:

    - Logitech keyboard ⌨️
- A 20lb weight 🏋️‍♀️
- Meditation cushion and bench 🧘
- Food 😋
    - 2lb frozen beef patties 🍔
    - 3 heads of broccoli 🌳
    - 7 onions ⚪️
    - A leek 🎋
    - 2 bundles of green onion 🎍
    - 18 eggs 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🍳🍳

    - Some Saint John's Wort with B12 and Folate that fate placed in my hands

Let me tell you, it was a real pain to carry all that uphill in my backpack.

### It's a drag I know
The olive oil is really gonna be doing the heavy lifting here, so it will be important to pace myself. A bit worried about running out of good foods, but I can always sneak back home to pick up more proteins and vegetables if it gets desperate.

There was already some food in the cabinets for me:

- ~5 cups of white rice
- A box of "instant rice", which I'm lead to believe is precooked and re-dehydrated. Isn't technology wonderful?
- A box of grits
- 500 individual packets of brown sugar
- 1/3 of a tube of oatmeal
- 1/3 packet of chia seeds

I stowed the grits, rice, and sugar back home – they needn't clutter my cabinets or my mind, but might be handy if shit really hits the fan.

I went a bit overkill on the clothes, considering there's no washing machine. In total I've got 3 pairs of pants, 4 pairs of underwear, 2 pairs of socks, 4 shirts and a sweater. I did make sure to bring my fancy fast-dry clothes at least. My strategy is to bring whatever I'm wearing into the shower each day to wash by hand. In practice I'll certainly forget, but it will be good to keep the underwear and socks moving at least.

Probably should do a full post on my supplement stack at some point, I'm pretty inconsistent about it. I haven't started taking the Piracetam yet, I'm waiting to feel really fresh and pure because it can knock me over with hyper-sensitivity if conditions aren't right. Never taken Saint John's Wort before, but my friend swears by it. Weak MAOI (Kava, Ayahuasca) have been pretty effective for me in the past, so I'm excited to try it. Don't want to make it a regular part of the stack though. Hopefully it acts quickly like kava – I've heard tale it may take weeks to take effect – fuck that… I may take it anyway just for the B12 that's bundled in. I think I'll take it tonight, as a (very) poor man's Ayahuasca.

I was supposed to go to an Ayahuasca ceremony tonight, but `#cancelEverything` 🤷‍♂️\
Perhaps its for the better, I've been feeling like the ceremonies aren't the best environment. Unless I plan to break through and puke everywhere (I think I don't, actually – I've thought about it very hard), I don't think there's much more it can give me. The afterglow is always nice though… so we'll see how the Wort goes 🙏.

### There's only one place to go
Something shifted in me, while I wasn't looking.

For the last week or so I've mysteriously gotten back into programming — thirst for javascript, no less. I consumed [Survive JS](#) back in 2015

So what's changed?

For one, the ecosystem is actually a lot nicer. Browser support for ES6 has stabilized, [create-react-app](#) makes everything work perfectly out of the box without configuring webpack/babel hell, and newish [react hooks](#) mostly obviate the use of redux (I think, maybe I will discover otherwise soon when I start writing more tests and debugging). It is all weirdly fragile though — all the hot paths are really, really slick (eg React, JSX) but the NPM ecosystem is surprisingly low quality. I still can't for the life of me find a good minimal set/map library that's popular and well maintained. ImmutableJS meets the latter criteria but it's bloated and ugly — I'll probably end up writing my own.

This time around I also discovered VS Code, and ~WoW~ having a real language-aware IDE is amazing. Mousover types, smart renaming, see-all-references, JSX and Emmet plugins — beautiful. I could never get into the jetbrains stuff because its so heavy - takes forever to load, a lot of confusing ceremony around starting a new project, and quite a steep curve. In fact, I tried [webstorm](#) first and it just flat out crashed immediately… typical bloat. VS Code is lightweight and intuitive enough to be useful immediately (after setting vim bindings, of course), and I've been picking up feature tricks as I go. The Haskell folks are right that an expressive language leans less on an IDE, but I think they're talking out their ass when they say we "don't need an IDE" — and quite frankly — it's an embarrasing sign of how poorly they understand ergonomics.

Typescript is really good now too. The typesystem is incredibly  flexible, on par with Scala but much less sound than any sane language. The types themselves are pretty noisy like Java (args always gotta be annotated, and named, despite the names never get used…). They get messy quickly if you try to do any fancy JS tricks, and all the APIs I see have overcomplex types. I think maybe it works best when you do stupid–simple things to reap the lowest hanging fruit types have to offer. Honestly, the most compelling reason to use TypeScript over plain JS is that it makes the editor work better — much smarter autocomplete, and self-documenting types on mouseover. JSON APIs get real messy, so the types are a documentation godsend here on their own, typechecking aside.

But the most important change came from within
after repeatedly ramming my head into Exordium (my Haskell-Prelude-for-Smarties), I realized the drive to delicious pure abstraction actually horribly contorts my spirit. Why do I do it? A good foundation for abstraction is critical no doubt — leaky core will fracture spectacularly as it grows. Who is it for? Seeking perfection in Haskell is always an uphill battle, the masses aren't ready. Code can be a [tool of thought](#), but Haskell isn't ready yet either. It's not relational, for one — and it doesn't understand understand state and entities (like eg Rust does). There are so many thoughts I want to think that get mangled on their way into code.

### I'm coming home

This quest for a perfect garden is driven internally: I have a vision and chisel it away into truth by bang my head against reality.

It can never be more than my vision and cleverness, and I must now admit that's a limitation.

But there's another way.

Embrace the 「[normcore](#)」.

Beaten paths are beaten for a reason, and in doing so the crucible forges something powerful – something beyond my imagination – if only I'm plastic enough to recieve it. Don't fight the path, or the path will fight you. In the normie world, people want to help you by default, rather than sabotage – because you're reinforcing their reality rather than sabotaging it. Insightful creativity bares enough low-hanging fruit to give us an edge even in the normie-world without reinventing everything over-eagerly. Such innovation must be kept out of sight, in the shaddows, for yourself – lest you be burned at the stake.

I do feel the gardener's itch coming again. I'll fight it — The Mission is too important for distraction — but I'll keep returning to it, until this world is 「pure」

Oh to have a traits library with modified prototypes — oh to have a sane collections library.

Sane collections are all I want, please 🙏
